# Web Scraping
Used the web scraper to scrape 3000 movies from IMDB, With each movie, i got the following features:
* Title 
*  Rating
*  Oscars
*  Total Nominations and Awards
*  Director
*  Gross 
*  MPAA Rating
*  Users Reviews Count
*  Critics Reviews Count
*  Ratings Number


# Data Cleaning


After scraping the data, I needed cleaned it up I made the following changes and created the following variables:
* Extracted the year of the movie out of the movie title
* Parser the oscar awards coloumn to create a coloum with numerical number of oscars won by each movie
* Created two columns from the total wins and awards column for the total wins and total awards numbers
* removed numeric letters and symbols from Gross, Users Reviews Count, Critics Reviews Count, and Ratings Number columns.
* Removed date from Gross column
* Removed duplicated rows
* Created a new boolean coloum for movies that are made after 2002
* Renamed the MPAA ratings to their correct names


# EDA

I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights
